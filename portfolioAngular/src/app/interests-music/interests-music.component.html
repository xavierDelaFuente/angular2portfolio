    <h4> I have always been related to music </h4>
    <br>
    <p> On my family, both my sisters have been studying in a music conservatory. They were learning piano, so when I had the proper age, I listed myself on the conservatory as well. There i learned piano for six years (even though I didn't got to 6th grade on piano). There I studied Solfeg (up to 6th grade) and harmony (2 years). However, i didn't like much the ways of learning in that school. I felt like it was too academic and that I didn't undertand or feel the music properly; it was like solving maths and I didn't like it that way.</p>
    <p> A couple o years later I got an electric guitar. It was one of my best decisions so far. When I got the guitar I started learning and playing by myself. Not much later, we created a band with some friends so we could meet to play and enjoy the music. We use to play rock or metal mostly but we played a lot of diverse genres, as the members of the band had different music tastes and that enriched the banc. The band had some memebers changes on their way, but it last up until I got to Barcelona to study to get my engineering degree (It was the year everyone was getting into) </p>
    <p> While I was on the band I got myself into electric guitar classes with a teacher I will always be greatfull. WIth him, I learned how to understand music even though you don't have any knowledge of solfeg. Thanks to him I was back to music. Actually I'm still playing both guitar and piano, and I have started to improve the list of instruments I play</p>
    <p> On college, we got the oportunity to develop a Pure Data application, and we decided to develop a mobile app where you could plug your guitar and play along. The app would catch your signal and you would be able to change the effects of the sound or play along some backing track we programm in. </p>
